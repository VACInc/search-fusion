/**
 * Provider Capability Taxonomy
 *
 * A lightweight, enumerated model that describes what each known web-search
 * provider is good at.  It is deliberately narrow: the goal is to give future
 * routing logic a stable vocabulary to reason over rather than trying to rank
 * providers along every possible dimension.
 *
 * Design principles
 * -----------------
 * - Additive: adding a new capability never breaks existing code.
 * - Non-exclusive: a provider can (and usually does) have multiple capabilities.
 * - Declared, not detected: capabilities are statically registered per provider
 *   id, not inferred at runtime from credentials or payloads.
 * - Conservative: only include capabilities we have reasonable evidence for; an
 *   empty set is valid and means "general-purpose / unknown".
 *
 * How routing code can use this
 * ------------------------------
 * A mode like "answers" can select providers where `hasCapability(p, "answer")`
 * is true; a "news" mode can prefer providers with "news"; cost-aware routing
 * can prefer providers with "free-tier"; etc.
 *
 *   import { resolveProviderCapabilities, hasCapability } from "./provider-capabilities.js";
 *
 *   const caps = resolveProviderCapabilities("gemini");
 *   if (hasCapability(caps, "answer")) { ... }

 * This is the single source of truth — keep it alphabetically sorted by key
